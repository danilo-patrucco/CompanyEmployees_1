/*To set which environment our application runs on, we need to set up the
* ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable. For example, to run
* the application in a production, we need to set it to the Production value
* on the machine we do the deployment to.
* We can set the variable through the command prompt by typing set
* ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Windows or export
* ASPNET_CORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Linux.*/
